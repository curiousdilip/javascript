# Weird history of Javascript

Netscape Navigator(browser) - 1995, Brendan Eich ---> he was working in netscape and created javacript in 10 day only

    - MOCHA ->> Livescript ->> Javascript

Internet Explorer - 1996 created JScript

netscape and internet explorer created their respective languages which caused problem for the website developers


Javascript went to ecma (which regulated the features to be removed or added to languages)


ES1 : 1997

ES5 : 2009 (lot of new features)
ES6 : 2015 (biggest update in the history of js), Modern Javascript , Ecma has a community tc39 which decides which feature will come or which feature will not

ES6 --> ES2015

ES7: ES2016
ES8: ES2017

Javascript is backward compatible , the feature that was brought 20 year ago will run today also
Javascript is not forward compatible , the new feature launched today will not run in 10 year old browser, to solve this we use babel that is a javascript compiler
